# PROG 01: Crunch Time

This app allows you to find the amount of calories you've burned for a given exercise and the amount of time/reps done. It also allows you to see the equivalent amount of work you did for that exercise in terms of number of reps of Pushups and Situps and minutes of Jumping Jacks and Jogging.
